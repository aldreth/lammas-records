contentHtml: "<p id=\"performer\">\n  Guildford Camerata</p>\n<h1>\n  Guildford Philharmonic
  Orchestra</h1>\n<p>\n  The Guildford Philharmonic is at the heart of music-making
  in the south east, with a huge repertoire extending from the 17th century to the
  present day. The main concert season runs from October to July in a variety of venues
  including the Guildford Civic, Guildford Cathedral, the Electric Theatre, Holy Trinity
  Church, the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Abbot’s Hospital, Wanborough Barn, the Castle
  Grounds, Shalford Park and the Lido. In addition, the orchestra is invited to give
  concerts throughout London and the south of England. Over the past few seasons,
  the Philharmonic has achieved the distinction of averaging 98% attendances across
  all of its events, and in 2000, all concerts sold out completely.</p>\n<p>\n  The
  Guildford Philharmonic's scope ranges from concerts for children and with children,
  via chamber concerts in more intimate venues, to large-scale choral and orchestral
  works. The repertoire covers everything from jazz and light music to new music,
  and the emphasis is to work with young soloists at the outset of their careers.
  En Shao was appointed Principal Conductor in 1995, following in the illustrious
  footsteps of Crossley Clitheroe, Vernon Handley, Sir Charles Groves and Sir Alexander
  Gibson. The orchestra continues its work of attracting new audiences for all types
  of classical music and of making concert-going an exciting experience.</p>\n<p>\n
  \ Guildford Borough Council has funded and managed the Philharmonic as part of its
  arts provision for the Borough since the orchestra's inception in 1945 (when it
  was the Guildford Municipal Orchestra). The Borough Council is grateful to the South
  East Arts Board, South East Music Trust, and to its major corporate sponsors BOC
  Gases, Borax Europe Ltd, The Guildford Nuffield Hospital, and Stevens &amp; Bolton.</p>\n<h2>\n
  \ Guildford Camerata</h2>\n<p class=\"staff\">\n  The Guildford Camerata is committed
  to the highest standards of ensemble singing. The choir's musical experience is
  wide and varied, its members having sung in cathedral choirs, college ensembles,
  professional choruses, oratorio and opera. The repertoire is large, from the 16th
  century to the present day, with the emphasis on the Baroque period and on British
  music. The choir gives concerts throughout London and the South-East, often with
  the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra. It has combined with the Choir of Guildford
  Cathedral for the Messiah and has given highly acclaimed performances of Bach's
  St John Passion and B Minor Mass with Nicholas Kraemer in Guildford Cathedral. The
  choir presented Music for Royal Occasions with Barry Rose during the 1999 Guildford
  International Music Festival; and as part of the 1999/2000 season performed A Christmas
  Fanfare with Nicholas Cleobury in Holy Trinity Church and the Fauré and Rutter Requiems
  conducted by Barry Rose and John Rutter respectively in Guildford Cathedral. During
  the 2000/2001 season it performed in the highly acclaimed Bach in Leipzig concert
  with Nicholas Kraemer, Handel’s Messiah conducted by John Rutter, and in the world
  premiere of Barry Rose's orchestrated version of Stainer's Crucifixion. Recently,
  the choir gave the UK premieres of John Rutter's Feel the Spirit in Guildford Cathedral
  in March 2002 and of his Mass of the Children, also in Guildford Cathedral, in March
  2003.</p>\n<h2>\n  Barry Rose</h2>\n<p class=\"staff\">\n  Barry Rose was appointed
  to be the first Organist and Master of the Choristers at the new Guildford Cathedral
  in May, 1960, whilst still a student at the Royal Academy of Music. At Guildford
  he founded a new choir and a pattern of daily sung Services, and was to stay at
  the cathedral for the next 14 years, during which time he was also appointed as
  the BBC’s Music Adviser to the Head of Religious Broadcasting. In 1974 he moved
  to St Paul’s Cathedral, to be sub-organist, but in 1977 took up the specially created
  post of Master of the Choir, which he held until 1984, when he went to The King’s
  School, Canterbury, as Master of the Choirs. In 1988 he was persuaded to return
  to cathedral music, as Master of the Music at the Cathedral and Abbey Church of
  St Alban, where he remained until 1997.</p>\n<p>\t\tNow living in Somerset, he spends
  a great deal of his time giving choral master-classes, especially in the USA, though
  he has maintained his links with Guildford through the recently celebrated 40th
  anniversary of the Consecration of the Cathedral and his concerts with the Guildford
  Camerata and the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>\n<p class=\"staff\">\n  Other
