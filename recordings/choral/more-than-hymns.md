  <h1>More Than Hymns</h1>
  <p>More than Hymns is the title of two collections of hymn-anthems recently published by Novello &amp; Co. Ten pieces from each of the two volumes have now been specially recorded for this CD by Wells Cathedral Choir.</p>
  <p>The texts and music embrace many periods and differing styles, ranging from the 17th century poetry of George Herbert to the 20th Century hymns and worship-songs of Sydney Carter and David Evans, whilst the music spans a period of four centuries, with several original compositions, together with new realisations and specially commissioned arrangements of well known tunes.</p>
  <h2>Malcolm Archer</h2>
  <p class="staff">Malcolm Archer was appointed Organist and Master of the Choristers at Wells Cathedral in 1996 where he directs and trains the Cathedral choir for its daily services in the Cathedral, as well as being the Musical Director for Wells Cathedral Oratorio Society.

    Malcolm was educated at King Edward VII School, Lytham, the Royal College of Music (where he was an RCO scholar) and Jesus College Cambridge where he was organ scholar. He studied the organ with Ralph Downes, Gillian Weir and Nicolas Kynaston, and composition with Herbert Sumsion and Alan Ridout. He continues to study the organ with Daniel Roth in Paris. He has given organ concerts in nine European countries, Canada and the USA.
