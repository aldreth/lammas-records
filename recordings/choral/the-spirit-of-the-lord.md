    The Spirit of the Lord</h1>
  <h2>
    Charles Villiers Stanford</h2>
  <p>
    Born in Dublin in 1852, Charles Villiers Stanford is considered by many to stand alongside Hubert Parry as a central figure in the ‘renaissance’ of British music at the end of the 19th century. His father was a lawyer and amateur musician and from a young age he was surrounded by culture, gaining insights into the music of many great composers, including Bach, Brahms and Mendelssohn. From a relatively young age Stanford was active as a composer, completing orchestral, chamber and sacred works before winning the organ scholarship to Queens College, Cambridge in 1870.</p>
  <p>
    Stanford’s time in Cambridge was a fruitful one - he was appointed conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society (CUMS) in 1873 and organist at Trinity College early the following year. He took time off from his duties at Trinity in both 1874 and 1875 to visit Leipzig and again in 1876 to visit Berlin, trips which surely expanded his already very broad musical horizons. Appointment as Professor of Music at Cambridge came in 1887.</p>
  <p>
    It is as a pedagogue that Stanford is generally remembered beyond church music circles. As Professor of Composition at the Royal College of Music (a post he held from 1883) he taught many of the next generation of British composers including Benjamin, Bridge, Butterworth, Dyson, Gurney, Howells, Ireland and Vaughan Williams. It is strange, therefore, that so few of his own works are heard today. In his own time his ‘Irish’ Symphony (No.3) was performed across Europe, most notably at the opening of the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, as well as in New York under the baton of Gustav Mahler in 1911. One field he yearned to achieve success in was that of Opera – he even lead a petition to London County Council appealing for the formation of a ‘national’ opera in 1898 – yet success largely eluded him. His opera Shamus O’Brien was, however, performed at the Broadway Theatre in New York in 1897.</p>
  <p>
    One issue that some analysts debate is that of Stanford’s ‘Irishness’. He was brought up in a privileged class descended from sixteenth and seventeenth century Englishmen. He supported the principles of the Act of Union (1800) and opposed Gladstone’s declaration of Home Rule in the later nineteenth century. He also banned performances of Shamus O’Brien in 1912, not wishing to be seen to encourage anti-Union sentiment. He must have, nonetheless, felt a spiritual bond with Ireland given the titles and material of many of his works. Even some of his organ pieces are based on Irish melodies.</p>
  <p>
    Knighted in 1902, Charles Villiers Stanford died in 1924 leaving a substantial legacy in both his former students and in his music.</p>
  <h2>
    Edward Elgar</h2>
  <p>
    Born near Worcester in 1857 to William Elgar, a musician and shop-owner, and Ann, an educated woman with an interest in music and the arts, the young Edward Elgar was from a young age exposed to music. Though he received tuition only upon the violin, Edward attracted attention though his piano improvisations. By the age of ten he was already writing music.</p>
  <p>
    A year working for a local Solicitor convinced him of his desire to pursue a career in music, and at sixteen Edward Elgar became a freelance musician, playing in many ensembles, both upon the violin and the bassoon. In 1884 he played first violin under Dvorˇák in the Three Choirs Festival of that year held in Worcester. By the later 1880s he had taken over from his father as organist of St.George’s Roman Catholic Church in Worcester.</p>
  <p>
    Despite a brief and unsuccessful stay in London at the beginning of the 1890s, Elgar’s music increased in popularity and by 1899 – the year the ‘Enigma’ Variations were born – he was a national figure. The premiere of The Dream of Gerontius a year later was somewhat less successful, yet its effect was enough to demonstrate the works enormous importance. Over the next few years Gerontius was heard across the continent. In 1904 the remarkable happened, for the first time a festival of music by a living British composer was held in Elgar’s honour at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. The disappointment of Gerontius’ genesis was consigned very firmly to history and, the success he so desired having been won, Elgar moved once more to London in 1912. Through works such as the ‘Pomp and Circumstance’ marches and later the Cello Concerto, Elgar had won the heart of a nation and a achieved a popularity across the musical world that remains undimmed to this day – one only needs to witness the ‘Last Night of the Proms’ for evidence of this.</p>
  <p>
    The greatest British composer of his day, his memory was honoured by the erection of a tablet in Westminster Abbey in 1972.</p>
  <h2>
