  <h1>En Prière</h1>
  <p>Each year the music at All Saints’ Church goes from strength to strength. Services in the church are usually sung by the choir of boys and men - an unbroken tradition dating back over 450 years. Alongside this, a separate girls’ choir sings regularly. Concerts and recitals given by the church’s own musicians and visiting artists also form part of the busy music programme. The choirs have made three recordings on the Lammas label, and regularly undertake foreign tours, most recently to Rhode Island, New York and France, and in the coming year to Italy, Germany and Switzerland.</p>

  <h2>The Girl Choristers of All Saints’ Church, Northampton</h2>
  <p>In 1994, a Girls’ Choir was formed at All Saints’ Church, Northampton, to complement the choir of Boys and Men which has sung for services for over 450 years. This recording was made to mark this tenth anniversary. The girls sing twice each week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as well as joining the Layclerks and Choral Scholars for occasional Sunday services. They regularly sing for major services, and have recently performed Duruflé’s Requiem and Britten’s Ceremony of Carols at the Liturgies for All Souls’ Day and Candlemas. The girls have undertaken tours with the men of the choir to South Carolina, Tuscany and France.</p>
  <p>On the final track of the CD, Duruflé’s In Paradisum, the girls are joined by a specially assembled group of Oxford-based gentlemen.</p>
  <h2>Edward Whiting</h2>
  <p class="staff">Edward Whiting was born in Norwich in 1979, was a chorister at Norwich Cathedral, and was educated at Norwich School.</p>
  <p class="staff">In 1997/8, he spent a year as Organ Scholar of Lincoln Cathedral, before taking up the Organ Scholarship at The Queen’s College, Oxford, where he read for a degree in music. Whilst at Queen’s, he appeared with the choir on tours to Spain, France and America, and conducted the twentieth century repertoire on their 2001 disc of Passiontide Music, Christ Rising.</p>
  <p class="staff">In 2001, he moved to Wells Cathedral where he spent a year assisting Malcolm Archer and Rupert Gough. In September 2002, he took up the post of Director of Music at All Saints, where he directs the boys, girls, choral scholars and layclerks in the five weekly sung services. In the past year, the choir has toured America and France, and premiered new works by Robert Walker, David Sanger and Malcolm Archer. Future plans include tours with the choir to Germany, Switzerland and Italy.</p>
  <h2>Richard Pinel</h2>
  <p class="staff">Richard Pinel was born in 1984. His musical career began in the choir of All Saints’ Church, Northampton, which he joined at the age of 7. After going through the ranks of chorister, organ scholar and spending two long periods jointly directing the choir, he took up the organ scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford in 2002.</p>
  <p class="staff">Whilst in Northampton he accompanied the choirs on a CD recording and on tour in Tuscany. In Oxford his duties include accompanying the regular daily worship, lately having played for the choir in a concert in Milan Cathedral and on a recording. Richard is also an active composer and his music has recently been enjoyed by HRH The Prince of Wales. In his spare time he is reading for a degree in music, and enjoys walking, reading, fine ales and watching the college deer graze outside his bedroom window.</p>
