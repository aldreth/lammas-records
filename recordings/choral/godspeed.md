contentHtml: "<h1>Godspeed</h1>\n<p>This CD was recorded in response to many requests
  from visitors for something 'local' by which to remember St Edmundsbury Cathedral.
  It therefore contains not only many universally popular pieces of choral music,
  but also two items peculiar to the Cathedral Choir. Both were commissioned by the
  R A Vestey Memorial Trust: the St Edmundsbury Mass by David Horne and the Pilgrim's
  Song (from 'A Liturgy for St James') by Philip Wilby.</p>\n<p>Bartholomew Gosnold,
  one of the earliest explorers of the Eastern United States, sailed from Suffolk
  in the boat 'Godspeed' in 1606. Sadly, his daughter Martha died before an earlier
  voyage: she was baptised and buried in what was then St James's Church, now the
  Cathedral. Martha's Vineyard was named by Gosnold in her memory.</p>\n<h2>St Edmundsbury
  Cathedral Choir</h2>\n<p>St Edmundsbury Cathedral Choir is a voluntary organisation
  working to the highest standards to provide music for the worship in St Edmundsbury
  Cathedral. The boys attend many different local primary, preparatory and middle
  schools, although about half attend St James's Middle School in the town. The Lay
  Clerks come from many different walks of life, and all are volunteers. The full
  choir sings four services a week, the boys sing an extra one each week on their
  own and rehearse most mornings before school.</p>\n<p>On top of this considerable
  commitment, the Cathedral Choir also provides music for special civic and diocesan
  events, termly visits to parishes in the diocese, and occasional concerts. They
  have appeared frequently on Radios 3 and 4, and broadcast (both live and recorded)
  on television. The choir goes on tour every two years. In 1998 they toured Picardy,
  including Bury St Edmunds's twin town of Compi\x8Fgne; in 2000 they visited Boston,
  Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, Massachusetts.</p>\n<h2>James Thomas</h2>\n<p class=\"staff\">Born
  in 1963, James read music as Organ Scholar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge,
  receiving tuition on the organ from Nicolas Kynaston. During this time he gained
  the FRCO, winning the Dixon prize for extemporisation.</p>\n<p class=\"staff\">After
  graduating, he spent a year at Homerton College, then, armed with a PGCE, lived
  in France for two years, assisting Robert Weddle with choral singing at the Conservatoire
  in Caen and learning the organ in Rouen with Louis Thiry. James returned to England
  in 1988 as Assistant Organist at Blackburn Cathedral, and Assistant Director of
  Music at St Wilfrid's C. of E. High School. He then moved to Chichester in 1991
  as Assistant Organist at the Cathedral and Director of Music at the Prebendal School.
  Here he met the daughter of one of his music staff: Katharine and he were married
  in the Cathedral in 1993. (Katharine is herself an accomplished musician, having
  been Organ Scholar at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.) They have two daughters.</p>\n<p
  class=\"staff\">James was appointed Director of Music at St Edmundsbury Cathedral
  in September 1997. In 1998 he was appointed conductor of the Cambridge Village Colleges
  Choral Society, and regularly gives organ recitals and conducts choral workshops
  in the diocese and beyond.</p>\n<h2>Michael Bawtree</h2>\n<p class=\"staff\">Michael
  Bawtree was born in Devon in 1975. He spent the year before university as Assistant
  Organist at King's School in Auckland, New Zealand; in 1994 he became Organ Scholar
  at Christ's College, Cambridge University, and graduated with a degree in music
  in June 1997. In January of that year, Michael became a Fellow of the Royal College
  of Organists, winning three prizes as a result of the examinations. Whilst in Cambridge
  he travelled extensively, performing with the Chapel Choir in Switzerland, France,
  Ireland, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Canada. With the group, he made three CD recordings
  and broadcast live on Radio New Zealand and Radio Television Hong Kong.</p>\n<p
  class=\"staff\">He became Assistant Director of Music at St Edmundsbury Cathedral
  in Suffolk in April 1999. In addition to his Cathedral work, Michael has conducted
  the Suffolk Sinfonia orchestra and has recently been appointed Musical Director
  of the Phoenix Singers; Michael teaches Keyboard Harmony to music undergraduates
  at Cambridge University and is also the Cathedral's Arts Co-ordinator, responsible
  for all concerts and exhibitions in the building.</p>\n<p class=\"staff\">Solo recital
  engagements have taken Michael to cathedrals across the British Isles (including
  St Paul's in London, St Giles' in Edinburgh, Christ Church in Dublin as well as
  Westminster Abbey and York Minster). In October 2001, he travelled to New England,
  performing at churches on Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, at Harvard University
  and at Trinity Church in the City of Boston.</p>"
