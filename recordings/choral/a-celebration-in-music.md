  <h2>The Choirs of Jesus College Cambridge</h2>
  <p>When John Alcock, Bishop of Ely, visited the Benedictine nunnery of St Radegund, he found only two nuns remaining - it is alleged - one of great age, the other pregnant. In 1496 he dissolved the convent and founded on the same site 'The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist, and the Glorious Virgin Saint Radegund', from its first days commonly called Jesus College. The existing nunnery buildings, including the twelfth century Chapel and surrounding Cloister Court, were incorporated into the new college and are thus the oldest collegiate buildings in Cambridge. Together with the College, Alcock (pictured on the cover) founded a chantry and grammar school to provide music for Chapel worship. Following the Reformation, the school was closed, and apart from a brief period between 1634 and 1642, services were conducted without music until 1849. In this year, a choir on the Cathedral model was introduced on the initiative of one of the fellows, Sir John Sutton, who also made the gift of a new organ by Bishop. The college's decision to become co-residential in the late 1970s led to the formation of the Mixed Choir in 1982, to operate in conjunction with the now long-established choir of men and boys; the Gentlemen being common to both. The boys are all drawn from local schools, and come to college four times each week for services and rehearsals. The adult singers are principally Choral Exhibitioners of Jesus College who, in addition to singing the Chapel services, are reading for a degree (in a wide variety of subjects) given by the University. The choirs are recruited, administered and directed by two organ scholars. A number of former holders of the post have proceded to distinguished careers in church music, among them Peter Hurford (international organ recitalist), Richard Lloyd (former Organist of Hereford and Durham Cathedrals; composer), John Turner (former Organist of Glasgow Cathedral), Malcolm Archer (former Organist of Bristol Cathedral, now of Wells Cathedral) and James O'Donnell (Master of Music at Westminster Cathedral).</p>
