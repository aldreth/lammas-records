  <h1>Living Bread</h1>
  <h2>Samuel Sebastian Wesley</h2>
  <p>Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810-1876) held posts in several English Cathedrals and at Winchester College, and was a great campaigner for reforming cathedral music which had descended to a low ebb in the first part of the nineteenth century. As a composer, he was the greatest and most significant between Purcell and Stanford and no more so than in his miniature works, of which Wash me throughly is one of the most haunting. The rising figuration of the opening solo is developed with a superb command of contrapuntal texture and daring harmony.</p>
  <h2>Giovanni Pierluigi Da Palestrina</h2>
  <p>Giovanni Pierluigi Da Palestrina (?1525-1594) composed prolifically for the church with no fewer than 104 masses and over 240 motets. He, along with Byrd and Lassus, is acknowledged as one of the greatest ever masters of polyphonic writing and his motet Ego sum panis vivus is one of the most lovely and most loved. In honour of the blessed sacrament and therefore central to the Maundy Thursday liturgies in Holy Week, it is in four parts.</p>
  <h2>Felix Mendelssohn</h2>
  <p>Although he composed many works for the church (many of which are relatively rarely performed), Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847) is perhaps best-known for his 1844 setting Hear my prayer for treble soloist and choir. The text is derived from Psalm 55. In the beautiful second section, O for the wings of a dove, there is some especially appropriate background noise from the seagulls in Truro, which are a feature of summer evenings!</p>
  <h2>Jonathan Battishill</h2>
  <p>The finely-wrought polyphonic writing of Jonathan Battishill’s anthem, O Lord, look down from heaven is very reminiscent of the Elizabethan period and elevates the work to a far higher level than most other 18th century Cathedral music. Battishill (1738-1801) almost certainly wrote the work with the huge acoustic of St Paul’s cathedral (where he had been a chorister) in mind, and its dramatic use of silence is equally effective in Truro’s smaller but nevertheless resonant acoustic. The seven-part final section contains some superb writing and handling of dissonance.</p>
  <h2>Gregorio Allegri</h2>
  <p>Gregorio Allegri (1582-1652) composed numerous masses and motets but his fame lies with the Miserere, a setting of Psalm 51 in for five-part and four-part choirs alternating with plainsong. It is the four-part sections, traditionally sung by soloists and including embellished writing up to top C for the first treble which have given the work its legendary status. There is disagreement amongst musicologists about these high passages’ authenticity: they are undoubtedly hauntingly beautiful when heard in liturgical context.</p>
  <h2>William Walton</h2>
  <p>As a chorister at Christ Church, Oxford, William Walton (1902-1983) showed precocious early promise as a composer and penned the deeply-expressive and immaculately-crafted A Litany at the age of only fifteen. It is remarkable to think that as a schoolboy, Walton devised the (then) daring harmonic progressions from scratch.</p>
  <h2>Alonso Lobo</h2>
  <p>The Spanish composer, Alonso Lobo (c.1555-1617) was maestro di capilla at Toledo Cathedral and subsequently at Seville Cathedral, and although he is far less well-known today than his contemporary Tomas Luis da Victoria, it is known that Victoria held him in high esteem. His mastery of polyphonic technique is seen with spectacular effect in his six-part Versa est in luctum and he clothes the words of lament in the most beautifully crafted lines.</p>
  <h2>Michael Wise</h2>
  <p>Michael Wise (c.1647-1687) was Organist of Salisbury Cathedral and latterly of St Paul’s Cathedral as well. He led a colourful life, and in the Episcopal visitation at Salisbury in 1683, accusations of negligence, profanity, drunkenness Òand other excesses in his life and conversationÓ were made of him. The ways of Sion is scored for solo treble and bass voices with two short choruses and is his masterpiece. His expressive writing and acute sense of pathos is evident throughout, particularly in the treble recitative, Is it nothing to you. In this recording, the accompaniment is played on the cathedral’s Tickell chamber organ.</p>
  <h2>César Franck</h2>
  <p>With his setting of Panis Angelicus, César Franck (1822-1890) eschews his characteristically chromatic harmonic language for a much more straightforward, melodic style which would have been popular with parishioners, no doubt, in late nineteenth century St Clotilde in Paris, where he was organist. Originally scored for tenor solo with organ, harp, Ôcello and doublebass, it is heard here sung by the choristers with organ accompaniment. The text picks up the eucharistic themes of Maundy Thursday.</p>
  <h2>Gerald Finzi</h2>
  <p>Gerald Finzi (1901-1956) developed a harmonic language very much in the English tradition inherited from his teacher, Edward Bairstow, and from Parry, Vaughan Williams and Elgar. Lo, the full, final sacrifice was commissioned by the Rev Walter Hussey for the choir of St Matthew’s Church, Northampton in 1946 and marked the fifty-third anniversary of the consecration of St Matthew’s. Its text, whilst referring to the penitential ideas of sacrifice, is really a triumphant Easter meditation on the Blessed Sacrament and as such ends this recording on an optimistic note of resurrection.</p>
  <h2>Truro Cathedral Choir</h2>
  <p>The choir of Truro Cathedral consists of eighteen boy choristers and twelve gentlemen. At the present time, there are seven lay vicars and five choral scholars; the lay vicars reside locally and have employment in or around Truro in addition to their duties at the cathedral, and the choral scholars spend a year in Truro either before or after higher education. The choristers are all educated at Polwhele House School, to which they receive generous scholarships from the cathedral.</p>
  <p>The choir’s primary function is to provide music which is carefully integrated with the magnificent ceremonial and liturgical excellence which characterises the cathedral’s worship. Each week there are six choral services, usually with the full choir, comprising Sung Mass and Evensong each Sunday and either Evensong or Solemn Mass on four weekdays. The music for these services is chosen to complement the liturgical themes of each season or festival.</p>
  <p>In addition, the choir presents a termly concert in the cathedral and regularly sings in other venues around the Duchy of Cornwall, carrying the mission of the cathedral out into the diocese. The choristers take part in a flourishing outreach project each term, going out to local schools with their music before hosting the school choirs for a concert of their own in the cathedral. The choir records and broadcasts regularly and undertakes a major international tour every two years or so. Plans for Summer 2004 include a tour to Austria and Switzerland and for 2005 to Canada.</p>
