contentHtml: "<h1>\n  St Albans Abbey Girls Choir</h1>\n<p>\n  In January 1996 a group
  of 25 girls aged 7-15 and from many different backgrounds came together to form
  the St Albans Abbey Girls’ Choir. Most had no experience of Evensong, of psalms,
  of robes or of processions. Under the inspirational guidance of the choir’s founder,
  Andrew Parnell, the girls achieved fine results in a very short space of time, and
  it soon became accepted that they were an important and valuable part of the life
  of the Abbey. The raison d’être of the choir is the office of evensong on Wednesdays
  and Fridays – these had formerly been plain days with no music. The choir also takes
  on more service work in the busy seasons to spread the load previously borne entirely
  by the Cathedral Choir, and is increasingly developing a concert role. An important
  part of the choir’s ethos is that it should be ‘different, but complementary’ to
  the boys’ choir.</p>\n<p>\t\tThe choir have sung Choral Evensong on BBC Radio 3
  and have recently appeared twice on BBC Songs of Praise. They have made a highly
  acclaimed CD recording - Awake my Soul – on the Lammas label. In December 2002 they
  undertook a complete performance (with early instruments) of Bach’s Christmas Oratorio,
  and in March 2003 they sang to HM the Queen and HRH Prince Philip. Several composers
  have written music especially for the choir, most recently Malcolm Archer and Richard
  Allain. In October 2003 the choir will undertake their first tour abroad – to the
  United States of America – where they will sing in Washington DC, Baltimore, Hagerstown
  and Richmond, Virginia.</p>\n<h1>\n  Lay Clerks of St Albans Cathedral Choir</h1>\n<p>\n
  \ The Cathedral Choir (of boys and lay clerks) was formed just over 120 years ago
  when the Abbey became a Cathedral. Before its dissolution by Henry VIII in 1539,
  the Benedictine monastery of St Albans Abbey had enjoyed a distinguished musical
  history, most notably when the composer Robert Fayrfax was employed.</p>\n<h2>\n
  \ Simon Johnson</h2>\n<p class=\"staff\">\n  Simon Johnson was born in Peterborough
  in 1975. He was a chorister and subsequently Head Chorister of Peterborough Cathedral
  Choir and he went on to hold organ scholarships at Rochester, Norwich and St Paul’s
  Cathedrals. He holds the organ diplomas of the Royal College of Organists, having
  won several major prizes at both.</p>\n<p>\t\tIn 1998 Simon was appointed Director
  of Music at All Saints’ Church in Northampton, where his work involved running the
  choir of men and boys, and also the separate girls’ choir. During this time the
  choirs toured France, Italy and Germany and made two CD recordings.</p>\n<p>\t\tSince
  being appointed Assistant Master of Music and Director of the Abbey Girls’ Choir
  at St Albans Cathedral in 2001, he has accompanied the Cathedral Choir on trips
  to Haarlem and Angers, performed on BBC television and radio, and on a CD recording.
  With the girls’ choir he has given premieres of works by Malcolm Archer and Richard
  Allain and made a CD recording; future plans include a tour of the USA.</p>\n<h2>\n
  \ James McVinnie</h2>\n<p class=\"staff\">\n  James McVinnie is Organ Scholar at
  the Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban. Currently in his second year in the
  post, he acts as accompanist to the Cathedral Choir, the Abbey Girls Choir, the
  St Albans Bach Choir and St Albans School Choir. Born in Kent, James was educated
  as a music scholar at Sevenoaks School, where he was school organist and organist
  to the Kent Youth Chamber Choir. In October this year he moves to read Music and
  be Organ Scholar at Clare College, Cambridge.</p>"
