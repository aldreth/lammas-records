  <p id="cdtitle">Music from the collections 'High Praise' and 'Merrily on High' (editor Dr. Barry Rose)</p>
  <h1>Praise On High</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Praise on High - a selection of items from two collections of sacred music for upper-voices, 'High Praise' and 'Merrily on High'.</p>
  <p>As editor of both volumes, when I first discussed the project with the publishers (Novello and Co), we agreed that our aim should be to make available a wide variety of music from different periods and styles to choirs of all standards - from school and community choirs to parish churches and cathedrals - and we hope that this recording may introduce you to some pieces that you would like your choir to sing.</p>
  <p>The differing but complementary sounds of boys and girls voices are represented in these 22 tracks, and we were delighted that the boys of St. George's Parish Church choir, Belfast, and the Armagh Girl Singers accepted our invitation to make this recording. We were also fortunate to be able to record in the inspiring spaces and gracious acoustic of St.Patrick's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Armagh, and for this, special thanks are due to the Administrator, Fr. Richard Naughton, as well as to the cathedral organist, George Minne, for his unfailing courtesy and assistance.</p>
