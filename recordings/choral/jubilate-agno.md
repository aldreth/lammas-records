  <h2>
    The Arcadian Singers of Oxford University</h2>
  <p>
    The Arcadian Singers of Oxford University, commonly called The Arcadians, were founded in 1976, to specialise in unaccompanied works. The choir aims to comprise about 25 singers from throughout the university, who sing a variety of music, covering a wide range of styles — Bach to Britten, Monteverdi to MacMillan. The choir gives at least one concert in Oxford each term and has in recent years been involved in other musical ventures both in and out of Oxford. They are regularly invited to contribute to the Easter Liturgy at Ampleforth Abbey in Yorkshire. The making of this recording marks the choir’s 25th anniversary.

     Matthew O’Donovan was born in 1981 and received his early musical training as a chorister of St. Giles’ Church, Oxford under Peter Ward Jones and a music scholar at Abingdon School, where he studied the organ with John Oxlade, and later David Goode, his current teacher. After completing his A-levels in 1999 he spent a year as organ scholar of Southwell Minster, where he worked both as an accompanist and also conductor with the Minster’s two choirs, studying the organ with Paul Hale. During his year at Southwell he directed the local Four Tons Choir. Matthew came up to Oxford in October 2000, where he is reading for a music degree and is organ scholar at Merton College. He was appointed conductor of the Arcadian Singers from April 2001. As a pianist and violist, Matthew has played with many of Oxford’s local orchestras. He also sings with the early music ensemble Stile Antico and with the Schola Cantorum of Oxford. He is manic about DIY.</p>

During his gap year he was Organ Scholar of Portsmouth Cathedral; the first holder of the position; and continued his organ studies with Neil Cockburn in London, and studied harmony and counterpoint with the Sub-Organist Rosemary Field.
