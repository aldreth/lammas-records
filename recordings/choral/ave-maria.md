contentHtml: "<h1>\n  Ave Maria</h1>\n<p>Both Saint-Saëns (1835-1921) and Fauré (1845-1924)
  worked in the most fashionable church in Paris, the Madeleine, parish church of
  the Elysée. Despite serving the church for almost fifty years between them, both
  were essentially atheist and took church employment until they could achieve financial
  independence. Their church compositions owed more to the salon or opera house than
  to the traditional heritage of Gregorian chant and renaissance polyphony. Saint-Saëns'
  setting of the medieval Marian antiphon Ave Maria was composed around 1860 and typifies
  this style with its prevalence of sentimental melody and harmony. In a style reminiscent
  of his ever popular Requiem, Fauré's Ave verum was composed in 1894. The text is
  a medieval sequence for Corpus Christi. Fauré's Ave Maria was completed in 1906
  and based on an earlier version of 1877. In a letter to his publisher, Fauré wrote
  of this motet: \"[it] is by nature destined more for the chapel or salon then for
  a large church. I see its future lying especially in the choral classes for young
  ladies.\"</p>\n<p>How like an angel was written by Malcolm Archer (b. 1952) in response
  to a commission from the MMA (Music Masters and Mistresses Association) in memory
  of Stanley Milne, and was first performed at the MMA conference when it was held
  in Clifton College, Bristol in 1998. The piece is a setting of a poem called Wonder
  by the seventeenth-century mystical writer Thomas Traherne. The Four Cathedrals'
  Service was commissioned by the biennial Four Cathedrals' Festival in the summer
  of 1996, and was first performed that year in Bristol Cathedral by the girl choristers
  of Bristol, Exeter, Salisbury and Wells Cathedrals.</p>\n<p>Daniel Roth (b. 1942)
  is the current Titulaire of the Grand Orgue in Sainte-Sulpice whose predecessors
  in this post include Marcel Dupré and Widor. The Ave Maria was composed by Daniel
  Roth in 1969 when he was organist at Sacré Coeur, Paris and was written for the
  male quartet of the church. It was edited in 1978 for the first magazine of Pueri
  Cantores and is equally suited to upper voices. The music is very much inspired
  by Gregorian chant.</p>\n<p>Joseph Rheinberger (1839-1901) was born at the court
  of the Prince of Liechtenstein, where his father was treasurer. He was clearly regarded
  as a local prodigy and at the age of twelve went to study in Munich where he lived
  for the rest of his life. As well as being one of the most sought-after teachers
  of composition and a much respected conductor and organist, his organ music was
  widely performed both on the continent and in England. Rheinberger was influenced
  by the Cecilian movement, which sought to restore to liturgical music a Palestrina-like
  purity that would not detract from the Mass. He wrote a total of eighteen masses
  which are reverential rather than dramatic and the Mass in E flat for three-part
  female choir and organ is no exception: a late work (1888) imbued with a deep serenity.
  The work is subtitled \"Reginae Sancti Rosarii\" (\"To the Queen of the Holy Rosary\").
  Much of the writing is very contrapuntal, including a Benedictus with the two higher
  voices in canon throughout, and with a simple organ accompaniment lending support
  and embellishment to the vocal writing.<br>\n  The Tree is a setting of verses from
  Job, commissioned by the Church Music Society on the occasion of its 75th anniversary
  in 1981 and was first performed at the Southern Cathedrals Festival the same year.
  Jonathan Harvey (b. 1939) creates in this work a musical form devoid of cultural
  roots: the music is not only timeless but also neither Eastern nor Western. The
  vocal line consists of a twelve tone melody with no tonal centre, and this is supported
  by sustained high-pitched clusters from the organ. The organ sound is inspired by
  the sound of the Japanese mouth organ (the 'Sho'), a pentatonic instrument that
  symbolises eternity to the Japanese. Each sung phrase seems to centre around a certain
  note, 'sprouting' ever further away from the centre as the piece progresses.</p>\n<p>The
  Scottish composer, Martin Dalby (b.1942), studied composition at the Royal College
  of Music with Herbert Howells. In 1965 he was appointed as a music producer to the
  BBC's newly formed Music Programme (later to be Radio 3). In 1971 he became the
  Cramb Research Fellow in Composition at the University of Glasgow and in 1972 returned
  to the BBC as Head of Music, Scotland. In 1993 he retired from the BBC and now composes
  full time. My song is in sighing, written in 1964, is a short and very simply conceived
  motet to words by Richard Rolle of Hampole (1290 - 1349?) which come from a longer
  poem depicting the poet's yearning to receive Christ into his life.</p>\n<p>Sigfrid
  Karg-Elert (1877-1933) succeeded Max Reger as Professor of Composition at the Leipzig
  Conservatorium in 1919. Years earlier, he had been a student there under Jadassohn
  and Reinecke, two very conservative masters with whom Frederick Delius also had
  studied. Like Delius, Karg-Elert had a natural gift for harmony and was encouraged
  to compose by Grieg. Although he left music for a variety of media, he is best remembered
  as a composer of organ music. His Three Symphonic Canzonas were composed in 1910.
  The basis of the third, which in its Epilogue adds violin and four-part female chorus
  to the organ, is the plainsong phrase Credo in unum Deo; credo in vitam venturi
  saeculi. In a self-revealing letter to his English friend Godfrey Sceats, Karg-Elert,
  son of a Catholic father and Protestant mother, wrote: 'I love this piece tenderly;
  it was written, frankly, in a vein of exaltation, and savours of holy water and
  consecrated candles...that is the Catholic side of me, which cannot readily be reconciled
  with Lutheranism.' The work is in F sharp major, a favourite key of Karg-Elert's.
  After a solemn presentation of the motto-theme, the Fugue begins, Sostenuto e misterioso,
  growing gradually in strength until the plainsong fragment, introduced at intervals
  like a choral above the fugal texture, builds up the main climax of the work. The
  central Canzona, based again on the motto-theme, also builds up to a powerful climax,
  and is linked to the Epilogue by the entry of the solo violin. After the voices
  have sung the phrase Credo in vitam venturi saeculi in unison, the violin plays
  an expressive melody in the high register, a self-quotation from an earlier work.
  This serves as a prelude to a polyphonic four-part Amen sung by the distant chorus
  beneath the violin's high held F sharp. After one final Credo in vitam venturi saeculi
  by the choir, the organ steals in to support the final Amens, while the violin relinquishes
  its high inverted pedal point to wreath a final arabesque to the hushed ending.</p>\n<p>Rupert
