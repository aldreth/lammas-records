  <h1>Evensong for St Andrew's Day</h1>
  <p>The history of choral music at Wells Cathedral goes back before the creation of the present building in 1180. The first Cathedral was built in 705 and the records of the Vicars Choral go back to 1136. It is known that there were boys singing at Wells even earlier than that.</p>
  <p>The service of Choral Evensong has been sung in English cathedrals since the Reformation, and is a fusion of the ancient monastic offices of Vespers and Compline. The musical items of Preces and Responses, Psalmody, the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis and the Anthem frame the ministry of the Word (the lessons, the Apostles' Creed and the intercessions) in an enduring art form of consummate beauty and perfection. The worshipper is drawn closer to God in a non-participatory form of worship which allows the beauty of the music and language to enter into the soul through personal prayer and meditation.</p>
  <p>Wells Cathedral celebrates its Patron Saint, Andrew at the end of November each year, traditionally with a Choral Eucharist in the morning and a Festal Choral Evensong in the Evening. The office of Evensong has been a rich vein of inspiration to composers over the years, and this disc allows the listener to eavesdrop on Evensong at Wells for St. Andrew's Day, and enjoy some of the finest choral works composed for the church in the twentieth century.</p>
  <p>It is particularly appropriate that we should sing William Walton's The Twelve, not only because the text is so suitable for the feast day of an Apostle, but also because 2002, the release year of this disc, is the centenary of Walton's birth. The work is dedicated to Dean Cuthbert Simpson, of Christ Church, Oxford, where Walton was a boy chorister, and sets words by the poet W. H. Auden, a sometime fellow of Christ Church. The work is a colourful and virtuoso display for choir, organ and soloists alike, and an original and imaginative treatment of the text.</p>
  <p>The Oxford connection continues in the composer of the Preces and Responses and the canticles. Bernard Rose was for many years Informator Choristarum (Organist and Choirmaster) at Magdalen College, Oxford, and taught in the University Music Faculty, as did Edmund Rubbra, of Worcester College who taught composition. The Preces and Responses by Rose were composed for the Magdalen Choir, and one response even quotes the bell chime in the Great Tower at Magdalen. Rubbra's Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in A flat is an astringent and powerful setting of the words, and each canticle is unified by the Gloria which has the distinctive organ rhythm of manual duplets against pedal triplets.</p>
  <p>The flag for Cambridge on this recording is flown by Charles Villiers Stanford, who was Professor of Music there. His setting of Justorum animae, one of a set of three motets, is dedicated to Alan Gray, Stanford's successor as Director of Music at Trinity, Cambridge, and is an inspired setting with a highly economical use of material. At the start of the disc, as we move into the cathedral in preparation for the service, we hear part of Stanford's Prelude No. 5. in G, which is based on a traditional Irish melody. His Fantasia and Toccata at the close of the service is distinguished by its strong musical ideas, and shows improvisatory flair within a taut musical structure.</p>
  <p>We hope that you will enjoy this music in the liturgical context for which it was intended, and will be enriched by the atmosphere of worship we hope to convey through music and word. We also hope that Wells will be a place of pilgrimage for you in the future, when you may be able to share with us in our daily choral tradition.</p>
