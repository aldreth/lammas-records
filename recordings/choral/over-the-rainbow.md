    Over The Rainbow</h1>
  <p>
    "Over the Rainbow" is a collection of twentieth century choral items, both sacred and secular, and is a selection from some of the music sung by the choir of the Cathedral and Abbey Church of St. Alban during three visits to the United States of America in the early 1990's. In cathedrals, churches and schools in Baltimore, Greenwich Conn, New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, Princeton, Orlando, Tampa, Palm Beach, Washington DC and Wilmington, the choir sang many of the so called standard classics of English church music whilst also introducing their audiences to some of the newer choral repertoire, both European and American.</p>
  <p>
    On this record we have consciously omitted works which have already been recorded by several other choirs, and out of the nineteen tracks you will now hear, we think that at least fourteen have been recorded for the first time in the UK, and probably more than that. In an age when musical versatility seems to be a pre-requisite not just of the great orchestras but now also of choirs, we make no apology for the inclusion of the secular items. Rather we hope that they will show you a different side of this cathedral choir whose priority remains the leading of the worship at this great Cathedral and Abbey Church.<br>
