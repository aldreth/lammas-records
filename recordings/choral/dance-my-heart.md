    Dance, my heart</h1>
  <p>
    "Vernacular materials are strongly evident, and there's no attempt to be stylistically pure. Old forms, shapes and tonalities rub shoulders with more contemporary devices"</p>
  <p>
    Robert Walker, note on the Piano Quintet (1984)</p>
  <h2>
    Robert Walker</h2>
  <p>
    For many years Robert Walker (born 1946) lived in Brinkwells, the Sussex cottage where Elgar composed his 'Cello Concerto (1918-1919), and the most obvious link between the two composers for the purpose of this recording. In fact the similarity between the two goes further. Both sought old forms and imbued them with new meaning. Both struggled to be accepted - Elgar retreated back to the Malverns having failed to gain recognition as a composer in London in his early career- Walker left Britain in 1992 to live in Bali having suffered neglect (much to the bewilderment of his audiences), and now lives and teaches in Thailand. Both composers were profoundly influenced by the environments in which they grew up - Elgar and the Malvern hills; Walker as a chorister at St Matthew's Church, Northampton, the remarkable church that commissioned works by Graham Sutherland, Henry Moore, Gerald Finzi and Benjamin Britten amongst others.</p>
  <p>
    Walker went on to study at Cambridge from 1965-68, before becoming Director of Music at Grimsby Parish Church, one of the few churches in the country with a choir school, for five years. In 1978 he made the decision to become a full-time composer. From 1982-1991 he was Professor of Composition at the London College of Music. His style, described so aptly in the above quotation, has been described as years ahead of fashion.</p>
  <p>
    Nowhere in this recording is this more evident than in Dance, my heart, which was written at the request of Michael Nicholas for the RSCM Cathedral Course at York Minster in August 1978. The words are from'One hundred poems of Kabir' translated by Rabindranath Tagore. The writing, for double choir and organ duet, is very lively, making extensive use of the possible rhythmic permutations within a single bar. A calmer second section, notable for whispered Sprechstimme ('Mad') leads us towards the serene Andante commodo in which the choir parts make use of an aleatoric technique above the gently undulating organ part. This soon gives way to the energy exposed at the opening, and the closing pages are an aural and performing tour de force.</p>
  <p>
    The aleatoric technique is again explored in the almost erotic As the apple tree; near the end of the work the choir sing the opening phrase entirely at their own speeds. The work was written for the marriage of Walker's nephew in 1982 and dedicated "To my Father, who only likes the black notes" (the piece is in D flat major).</p>
  <h2>
    Edward Elgar</h2>
  <p class="staff">
    Edward Elgar was born in Broadheath, near Worcester in 1857. He is seen as the best British composer of his day and ranks as one of the finest European romantic artists. Throughout his life he received very little formal training in music (lack of means prevented him from studying in London or Leipzig); it is possible that because of this Elgar's distinctive and original musical voice shines through.</p>
  <p class="staff">
    Elgar grew up in a highly musical environment in Worcester. His father was well known throughout the region as a competent musician, the owner of a music shop and the local piano tuner. From 1846 Elgar's father had been organist of St George's Roman Catholic Church in Worcester; the young Elgar became his assistant there before succeeding him in 1885. It was here that many of Elgar's early choral pieces were first performed, such as the motets Ave verum corpus, Ave Maria, Intende voci orationis meae (1886-87) and Ecce Sacerdos (1888). Whilst the motets are miniatures of consummate charm and beauty, Ecce Sacerdos foreshadows the grand processional style characteristic of Elgar's more mature style.</p>
  <p class="staff">
    The city of Worcester is synonymous with the great Three Choirs Festival, and this presented Elgar with many opportunities for employment, both as a performer and composer. The short oratorio The Light of Life was composed in 1896 and first performed as part of the Worcester Three Choirs Festival on 18th September of that year. Within this oratorio can be found the anthems Light of the World and Seek him that maketh the seven stars. Light of the world is typically Elgarian in its use of strong thematic motives and exhilarating modulations. Seek him that maketh the seven stars is altogether a more gentle piece for men's voices making extensive use of appoggiatura techniques. Two dramatic sections for tenor solo break the indulgence of the tutti sections.</p>
  <h2>
    Sheffield Cathedral Choir</h2>
  <p>
    The Cathedral Choir sings Evensong on each weekday except Monday during term-time at 5.45pm. Sunday services are the Sung Eucharist at 10.30am and Evensong at 6.30pm. Currently there are some 60 young people are involved in the Cathedral Choir. These children attend schools all over the city of Sheffield, and come in to rehearsals and services up to five times each week to be joined by the Cathedral Songmen and Student Songmen.</p>
  <p>
    The boy and girl choristers all receive individual singing tuition from a specialist vocal tutor during their time in the choir, and, in addition to their regular services, the Cathedral Choir often gives concerts in the Cathedral and beyond, broadcasts on radio and television, and tours at home and abroad.
