contentHtml: "<h1>Dreaming Of Christmas</h1>\n \n<p> It all seemed so perfect. We
  had the cathedral, we had the choir, we had the recording dates, and we had all
  the music carefully rehearsed, since we were to sing it in our annual concert of
  Christmas Music by Candlelight. We even had an arrangement of \"I\"m dreaming of
  a white Christmas\". But something was missing. Of course, the snow! You can\"t
  have a white Christmas without snow. So we tried to find a good photo of the Cathedral
  in the snow, but to no avail. Then our colleagues in the geography department at
  Wells Cathedral School told us that, since Wells is a \"mini urban heat island\"
  it very rarely snows, and the chances of it snowing sufficiently in time for our
  recording were about as good as winning the National Lottery! So there was only
  one thing for it. We would have to import some snow! </p>\n \n<p> That was where
  the enterprising ingenuity of Bridget Cunningham and Wells Cathedral School marketing
  department came in handy. Bridget managed to arrange a small mention of our dilemma
  in the Daily Telegraph \"Peterborough\" column, and within a few days a company
  called Air Products plc had come to the rescue. </p>\n \n<p> So it was, that on
  a bleak November day, a large lorry arrived in the peaceful surroundings of Wells
  Cathedral containing vast quantities of real snow, carefully made by Air Products
  plc. It was brilliant, it was cold, it was soft, it felt like snow and could also
  be made into snow balls. The arrival was closely followed by TV cameras and news
  photographers who had heard of the unusual occurrence which was to take place. The
  great West front of Wells Cathedral was to become a more spectacular snow scene
  than even mother nature could have arranged, and the Cathedral choristers would
  be photographed there for their Christmas recording. At last, all was perfect. </p>\n
  \n<p> Or so we thought, until it started to rain! So we waited and waited, and finally,
  in the late morning the clouds cleared, and we had the perfect conditions for a
  snowball fight and a photo session. </p>\n \n<p> The recording is a mixture of some
  familiar and favourite music with some less familiar but no less beautiful items.
  The familiar items, such as White Christmas will need no introduction, but some
  others may. The setting of O magnum mysterium by Victoria is one of the finest settings
  of this Christmas text by this sixteenth century Spanish composer. Similarly fine
  is the setting by the French composer Poulenc of Hodie Christus natus est (Today,
  Christ is born) with its vigorous and distinctive style, recorded in his centenary
  year. The setting of O little town of Bethlehem may be new to many, but it uses
  a superb melody from the Methodist Hymn Book by Joseph Barnby in an arrangement
  by Malcolm Archer. The traditional Irish melody for Today Maiden Mary comes from
  the Cowley Carol Book and is splendidly arranged here by Michael Nicholas, formerly
  Organist of Norwich Cathedral. The arrangement of Silent Night by Barry Rose was
  written for a carol record with Guildford Cathedral Choir in the 1960's, a record
  which went on to become a best all time seller. The simplicity and magic of this
  carol is well caught in this highly effective setting. </p>\n \n<p> This is the
  first recording of Where do Christmas songs begin by Malcolm Archer to a text by
  the modern hymn writer Bishop Timothy Dudley-Smith. This flowing and lyrical setting
  of these words gives every section of the choir opportunity for expressive singing.
  Gerald Hendrie's As I outrode this enderes night was composed for Christmas 1962
  for the Choristers of Norwich Cathedral, while he was acting Organist there. It
  was written for the choristers to sing from the organ loft with the composer accompanying.
  It has great rhythmic appeal, with its repeated 'terliterlow' refrain and the ending
  melts away with beautiful four-part chords from the treble voices. Also included
  is Irving Berlin's all time classic I'm dreaming of a white Christmas (RealAudio
  sample), in a short special arrangement for treble voices. After much soul searching
  it was this song which provided the inspiration for the title of the disc. </p>\n
  \n<p> No Christmas selection would be complete without The twelve days of Christmas,
  and this arrangement is sung annually in Wells Cathedral at the end of the highly
  successful and popular 'Christmas Music by Candlelight' concerts, which now take
  place on two consecutive nights. The disc opens with a bright and lively setting
  of I saw three ships which sets the spirited mood of the recording and hopefully
  will fill all who listen with plenty of seasonal cheer! </p>"
