  <h2>Choir of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh</h2>
  <p>The Choir of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh is Scotland's premier cathedral choir and unique in Scotland, maintaining as it does a daily choral tradition. The choristers are educated at St Mary's Music School, which acts as the choir school for the cathedral, again unique in Scotland. In 1978 St Mary's Cathedral became the first to offer girls scholarships to sing with the boys as trebles. The lay clerks of the choir consist of undergraduate choral scholars reading a diverse range of subjects at Edinburgh University, and more experienced singers.</p>
  <p>The choir broadcasts frequently on BBC Radio 3 and television and has made a number of recordings on the Herald, Lammas and Priory labels. It has a busy schedule of concerts, and, in recent years, has worked with the King's Consort, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Scottish Concert Orchestra and the Scottish Early Music Consort. It has toured extensively within recent years; including France in 1994 when the choir received a standing ovation at Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris. In 1996 the choir undertook a tour of English cathedrals and abbeys, where the concert it gave in Westminster Abbey was described in Choir and Organ as "an exquisite performance". In 1997 the Choir toured Holland and America. They also toured Germany with the London Festival Orchestra and took part in the European Festival of Music in Basle, Switzerland.</p>
  <p>During the Edinburgh International Festival, the choir is in residence, singing the daily services and broadcasting Choral Evensong on BBC Radio 3. In addition it gives a number of concerts in the Festival Fringe. Highlights in the current season include a performance of Handels Messiah with the BT Scottish Ensemble, a concert with Unique Events as part of the official 2000 Hogmany celebrations and two CD recordings. Plans are in hand for tours to Malta in 2001, Norway in 2002 and the USA in 2003.</p>
  <p>The choir regularly features works by contemporary composers in its repertoire: three commissions from Kenneth Leighton, a Scottish premiére of John Tavener's Hymns of Paradise with the London Festival Orchestra, and a commission from Francis Grier, Salve Regina. In November, 1999, the choir gave the first performance of Adam Lay y bounden by Howard Skempton and in August of 2000 will give the first performance of a new work by Francis Jackson. Forthcoming commissions also include Richard Allain, James MacMillan and Swedish composer, Jan Sandström.</p>
