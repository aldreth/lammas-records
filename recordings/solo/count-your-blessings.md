  <h1>Count Your Blessings</h1>
  <p>There are so many beautiful treble solos in the repertoire, and as a church chorister for the last seven years, and currently Head Chorister of St. Peter's Church, St. Albans, David Wigram has enjoyed many opportunities to sing these works during weekly church services. The selection chosen for this recording brings you some of the songs, hymns and anthems he has particularly enjoyed performing. St. Peter's is one of the few parish churches in England where full Matins and Evensong are sung every week, enabling both the choir and congregation to continue to know and appreciate the rich variety of church music, particularly the wide range of settings of the canticles by baroque, classical, romantic and 20th century composers.</p>
  <p>Of the many wonderful new hymns of the past two decades, David has chosen two favourites, Here I am, Lord, and Be still, for the presence of the Lord, and of the more traditional hymns, Sun of my soul, and the 23rd Psalm set to the beautiful and lyrical Brother James' Air by James Leith MacBeth Bain. David has a special fondness for Mendelssohn's music, many of whose works are sung at St. Peter's. O Rest in the Lord is a contralto aria sung by the 'angel' in his well-known oratorio Elijah, written in 1846 for a festival performance in Birmingham. The anthem Hear my prayer is of significance to lovers of church music since the remarkable and historical recordings by Ernest Lough in the 1930's with George Thalben-Ball at the Temple Church, London. David has been performing parts of it since the age of ten and eventually took the lengthy solo part in the complete work during the St. Albans International Organ Festival in 1999.</p>
  <p>Two settings of Ave Maria are included in this selection. The first is by Simon Lindley who was assistant organist at St. Albans Abbey in the 1970's, and was written as an anthem for treble voices, inspired by the music of the then organist at St. Albans Abbey, Dr. Peter Hurford. David sings both parts, double tracked, in this anthem, as he also does in Humperdinck's Sleep Song and Rutter's The Lord bless you and keep you. The second setting is the well-known arrangement by Gounod, a Parisien composer of the nineteenth century, using Bach's first prelude of the 48 Preludes and Fugues. Further French influence is found in CŽsar Franck's Panis Angelicus, often sung during communion. Gabriel FaurŽ's remarkable and evocative Requiem Mass is included in worship every year on All Soul's Day at St. Peter's, and the quality of the Pie Jesu, while a demanding solo, is enhanced by the pure, clear voice of a boy treble.</p>
  <p>Short, soft and gentle anthems sung during communion were favourites of the romantic composers in the Victorian era. Lead me Lord, by Samuel Sebastian Wesley, one of the most prolific composers of the 19th Century, and God be in my head by Henry Walford Davies, Thalben-Ball's predecessor at the Temple Church in London, are two fine examples, and have become gems in the repertoire. Thalben-Ball, coincidentally, gave the inaugural recital on the new organ in St. Peter's Church in 1974.</p>
  <p>Two settings of Ave Verum Corpus have also been included, arrangements of the anthems for full choir. Both have their place in the church repertoire and are fine examples of the choral writing of their composers. Mozart's setting has become one of the most loved and well-known anthems, while the setting by Elgar was among his earliest works.</p>
  <p>Reginald Morgan's song Count your blessings, published in 1946, holds a powerful message, both for when it was written and in our present lives, and it is the timeless and enduring words by Edith Temple that caused David to select this as the title of his CD.</p>
  <p>Michael Head's carol, The Little Road to Bethlehem, has special significance as the words, by Margaret Rose, were apparently inspired by the sight of the lambs in the fields at sunset in North Weald, Essex, where David's grandfather's family have lived for many years. John Rutter, formerly organist of Clare College, Cambridge, has added immeasurably to church music, particularly with the carols he has composed and the edited volumes of Carols for Choirs, in partnership with Sir David Willcocks. All things bright and beautiful is a hymn with many tunes, but here the rhythmic and syncopated accompaniment supports a beautifully constructed melody. Rutter's remarkable gift for writing a good tune and then enhancing it with sensitive and emotionally stimulating harmony, making him almost the Andrew Lloyd Webber of English church music, can be found in The Lord bless you and keep you, where David has recorded both parts.</p>
  <p>The secular works on this CD include The Ash Grove, a lovely Welsh folk song, with an enduring tune, to which the accompaniment was improvised during the recording. Bless this house, while a secular song which has also achieved great popularity in times past, is nevertheless a prayer. Walking in the Air from Howard Blake's score for the animated film of Raymond Briggs' Christmas story The Snowman for children (of all ages) has achieved tremendous popularity, and conjures up images of the small boy grasping the hand of his snowman, flying through the dark night sky to the land of Snowmen and Father Christmas.</p>
