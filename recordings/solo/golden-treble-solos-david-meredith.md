  <h1>Golden Treble Solos</h1>
  <p>All of the works on this recording are musical gems which for one reason or another have earned an enduring place in the solo soprano repertory and which, through their exquisite crafting for the human voice are assured a lasting popularity. The composers are wide ranging and span several centuries from J.S.Bach to the present day.</p>
  <p>Schubert's beautiful Ave Maria (RealAudio) is a prayer to the Virgin Mary, Hail Mary full of grace and is full of the composer's characteristic gift for melody which can be found in much of his music but most noticeably in his songs. Later in the recording the same words are set by Gounod, a Parisian composer who lived from 1818 to 1893. Michael Head was a twentieth century English composer who also had a great gift for melody. He was born in 1900 and was educated at the Royal Academy of Music where he later became Professor of piano. The Lord's my shepherd is one of the most popular hymns, especially when sung to the tune Crimond. The words are a metrical setting of Psalm 23.</p>
  <p>Fauré's Pie Jesu is a movement from his timeless and ethereal Requiem Mass. Fauré had a very strong influence on many French composers of his time and Maurice Ravel was among his pupils. The Call comes from Vaughan Williams' Five Mystical Songs, and is a setting of words by George Herbert. Originally composed to be sung by a baritone; this works equally well when sung by a treble. Mozart's Agnus Dei comes from his Mass in C (the Coronation Mass). The translation of the Latin words is: O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Bach's setting of Jesu, joy of man's desiring comes from his Cantata No. 147 and has become a favourite choice for weddings.<br>
    The day thou gavest Lord, is ended, is another hymn of durable popularity and is sung to the tune St Clement, composed by Clement Cotterill Scholefield. Mozart's Ave verum corpus (Hail, true body) is a communion motet, and its reflective nature and melodic appeal has ensured a place in the repertory of most liturgical choirs, as indeed has his setting of Laudate Dominum. The words Sleep my baby are set here to a traditional Welsh folk tune of haunting simplicity.</p>
  <p>William Blake's powerful words for Jerusalem could never be separated from Hubert Parry's magnificent tune, and it has almost become our second National Anthem. Another of Parry's tunes (Repton) is sung to Dear Lord and Father of mankind, which was composed for his oratorio 'Judith'. Panis angelicus (Bread of angels) is another work which is suitable for the communion and is set to music by the Parisian composer César Franck, who had enormous influence on French composers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
  <p>Of the other hymns included here, Morning has broken and Amazing grace both have a special place in the hearts of many people. The former is sung to an old Gaelic melody, and the latter has American origins and is based on an old Shaker tune. O for the wings of a dove (RealAudio) comes from Mendelssohn's anthem 'Hear my prayer' which has a 'tour-de-force' of a treble solo, and singing this solo is the secret desire of most choristers. Love one another comes from the longer anthem 'Blessed be the God and Father' by S S Wesley, who was organist at several English Cathedrals including Exeter, Hereford, Winchester and Gloucester. The disc ends with a charming setting of A grateful heart by the English song writer Mary Plumstead. This simple yet effective piece is dedicated to Angela and Brian Rayner Cook and is a setting of words by George Herbert.</p>
