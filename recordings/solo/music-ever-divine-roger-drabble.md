  <h2>Roger Drabble</h2>
  <p>Roger Drabble was born on 7 January 1983 in Exeter, the youngest of four children in a musically involved West Devon family. His vocal talent was first spotted by staff at St Rumon¹s Infant School, Tavistock. In 1990, at the age of seven, he was admitted to Exeter Cathedral Choir as a Probationer, ultimately becoming Head Chorister there five years later under the direction of Lucian Nethsingha.</p>
  <p>In September 1996 Roger transferred to Wells Cathedral School in Somerset for his Secondary education and was immediately invited by Malcolm Archer to join Wells Cathedral Choir. A year later, in September 1997, he became Head Chorister once again, this time at Wells.<br>
    Roger is a talented treble and a confident soloist with an extensive repertoire. He has travelled widely and performed in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, France and the Channel Islands. At home he has sung at the Four Choirs Festival, the Three Spires Festival, the Edington Music Festival and at numerous concerts throughout the South West including concerts with the Bournmouth Sinfonietta and the Exeter University Sinfonietta.</p>
  <p>His solo lead at a candlelit performance of the Allegri Misereri in the 1996 Exeter Festival with Schola Cantorum was a particular highlight for him which attracted excellent reviews at the time.<br>
    His BBC broadcast appearances have included Radio 4 Morning Service with Sir Harry Secombe, Radio 3 Choral Evensongs (3), Blue Peter, BBCTV Sunday Morning Worship and a Radio Bristol concert. Over the years he has sung in the presence of many distinguished people including HRH The Prince of Wales and HRH The Duchess of Kent.</p>
  <p>Outside the choir Roger is a gifted trumpet player and keen sportsman, currently studying at Wells Cathedral School. (1968)</p>
