  <h1>Sounds Symphonic</h1>
  <p>The music on this disc represents an 'apostolic' succession of teacher/pupil composers, active in Paris and spanning over a century. Each composer was a virtuoso organist, devoted to their work as liturgical improvisers: providing spontaneously crafted compositions for the ceremonies of the church. The works presented are 'symphonic' both in terms of form (the Vierne and Franck) and also in the orchestral way in which the the organ is used (Duruflé, Dupré and Cochereau - although each of these three handled more massive formal structures with consummate ease). The organ upon which they are played is unique in English cathedrals for its unashamedly French reed stops (which include 'brass' instruments in organ nomenclature), lush yet transparent foundation stops (the 'strings' of the orchestra) and its bright yet blending mixtures (which reinforce the harmonics of individual notes). The music is interpreted by Ian Ball, who grew up with the sound of Debussy, Franck and Ravel (his father being an unashamed Francophile), and who now studies every six weeks in Paris with Naji Hakim, Organiste Titulaire at the Eglise de la Sainte-Trinité, and a former pupil of Jean Langlais and Rolande Falcinelli.</p>
