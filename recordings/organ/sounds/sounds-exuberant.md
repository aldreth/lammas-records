  <p id="performer">Music by Christopher Boodle</p>
  <h1>Sounds Exuberant</h1>
  <p>My first introduction to the organ music of Christopher Boodle was in 1998 while browsing the shelves of a music store in London. I came across a copy of Toccata Éclatante and was immediately struck by the vigour of its writing and the creativity of its musical ideas. I was also thrilled to see that it was so obviously written with the player in mind, and that it would work smoothly and effectively on most instruments. I bought the piece, learned it, and subsequently gave its first broadcast performance on BBC Radio 3 in December 1998. Shortly after the broadcast, the composer and I made contact and I was introduced to more of his music, and thus began a fruitful and creative relationship between composer and performer.</p>
  <p>Christopher Boodle’s organ music is quite unlike any other composer’s with which I am familiar. It runs the gamut of creative design: sometimes it is stark and earthy; at other times lyrical and tender. It is often uncompromising in its tonality, but it is never humdrum or predictable. It is typified by driving rhythm, with frequent repeated chords and ostinato figures. The music is often witty, and the allusions to the melodies or style of other composers never fails to give delight to both performer and audience. Christopher Boodle uses the organ as a powerful resource, and he paints a broad and vivid canvas contrasting unusual colours and unexpected sonorities with the immense joy and verve of some of the most exciting organ music I have been privileged to play.<br>
    This CD is the fulfilment of a long-held wish to bring together a representative collection of some of Christopher Boodle’s best work. The pieces on this recording span nearly twenty years of creative endeavour. They are extremely varied, and there is certainly something for everyone here: even for those who are not particularly engaged by contemporary organ works. This is one of the great gifts of this music. It is accessible, engaging, and exciting. I hope that the new audience gained through the release of this recording will find the music as rewarding as those audiences who have heard it so far.</p>
