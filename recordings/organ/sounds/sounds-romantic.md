  <h1>Sounds Romantic</h1>
  <h2>Organ Sonata op.28 Edward Elgar</h2>
  <p>The Organ Sonata received an unfortunate first performance in 1895, at the hands of Hugh Blair. In writing about the work, Keith John quotes an account by the Headmistress of a school at which Elgar taught:</p>
  <p>‘His performance of the Sonata showed that he had either not learned it or else had celebrated the event unwisely, for he made a terrible mess of poor Elgar’s work. I was present at this débacle and commiserated with the Genius. But with a splendid flash of loyalty he refused to blame the murderer who, he said, had not had time thoroughly to study the victim.’</p>
  <p>One has to sympathise with the hapless Blair, who had barely a few days to conquer Elgar’s demanding score! Subsequent performances, both from organists and in its orchestrated form, have confirmed Elgar’s Sonata to be one of the greatest works of its kind. From a bold opening movement, through a lighter Intermezzo and deeply felt Adagio the listener is treated to a range of colours and emotions from organ and organist. A sonata-form final movement closes the work in imposing fashion. Throughout one can see why, half a century after its composition, Gordon Jacob was inspired to orchestrate Elgar’s most substantial contribution to the organ repertoire.</p>
  <h2>Fantasia and Toccata, op.57 Charles Villiers Stanford</h2>
  <p>Dating from 1894 and dedicated to Sir Walter Parratt, Fantasia and Toccata is one of a handful of very fine larger-scale organ pieces by Stanford. The Fantasia juxtaposes rhapsodic and arresting writing with gentler moments, which ultimately win the struggle as the piece dies away. The relaxed conclusion of the Fantasia is quickly forgotten, however, as the Toccata begins with a pedal solo which announces the beginning of an inexorable build up, through much free contrapuntal writing, to a Maestoso conclusion.</p>
  <h2>Six Short Preludes and Postludes, set 2 op.105 C V Stanford</h2>
  <p>Stanford’s two books of Short Preludes and Postludes were published in 1907 and 1908. The first two pieces in the second set use themes by Orlando Gibbons as thematic material, the flowing andante tranquillo feel of the first contrasting with the loud, homophonic allegro of the second. The third is a gentle lento whilst the forth and fifth perhaps reveal Stanford’s interest in Bach. The former is a setting of another Gibbons’ melody that puts the theme in the pedals beneath duo writing for the manuals. The latter is a strict trio. The sixth piece, the popular Postlude in d minor is more extended than the other pieces and provides a fitting close to the set.</p>
  <h2>Pomp and Circumstance march no.4, op.39 Edward Elgar</h2>
  <p>Edward Elgar’s ‘Pomp and Circumstance’ military marches were written over a number of years. The first, containing the evergreen ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ theme (whose added words, incidentally, Elgar attempted to alter upon the outbreak of war in 1914) was published in 1901. The next two, and the fifth, are less popular, whilst the forth is undoubtedly the best known besides the first one. It was premiered by Henry Wood at the Queen’s Hall in 1907, and is presented here in a highly effective (and rather fun, it must be said!) organ transcription.</p>
