  <h1>Russian Organ Music</h1>
  <p>Most of the pieces selected for this recording were composed under the influence of the German organ tradition and German style of organs in Russia, above all in St Petersburg and Moscow. Three Fugues (Berlin, 1833-4) by the founder of classical Russian music, Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka, should be treated in the spirit of extempore organ improvisations. It is highly likely that they were performed by the composer himself on the house organ "Sebastianon" of his friend Vladimir Odoyevsky in the private organ recitals attended by the créme de la créme of the mid nineteenth century Moscow and St Petersburg intelligentsia.</p>
  <p>The dynamics and registration of Vladimir Fyodorovitch Odoyevsky"s Prayer without words stem from the composer, who seems to have conceived them for his organ "Sebastianon". Prelude in G major by Constantin Fyodorovich Homilius, the organist of the German Reformed church in St Petersburg, is a brilliant concert piece for organ. The influence of the violin technique and the opera style is evident in this piece, and should not be a surprise, as the composer, being primarily a violinist, played this instrument at the Imperial Opera in St Petersburg.</p>
  <p>Alexander Konstantinovich Glazunov's Prelude and Fugue in D major, Opus 93 (1906), is his first composition written for organ. This composer's early piece already reveals the characteristic traits of the Russian symphonic style: monumentality, epic breadth, a close proximity to folk music and poetry, and a consummate mastery of counterpoint.</p>
  <p>The composer and music critic Yevgeny Ottovich Gunst belongs to the Moscow school which is associated with such names as Tchaikovsky, Taneyev and Scriabin. The influence of these composers is evident in his chamber music as well as in his Canon for the organ. Born in Kiev, the composer, concert pianist, and professor of the St Petersburg Conservatoire (1909-1942) Leonid Vladimirovich Nikolayev became famous as a leading representative of the Russian piano tradition that later became known as the "Nikolayev School". His pupils included Shostakovitch, Sofronitsky, Yudina and Serebryakov. His Fugue in E flat major was originally written for the piano, later Nikolayev himself wrote the organ version.</p>
  <p>The composer, pianist and organist Alexander Fyodorovich Goedicke held the position of Head of the Organ Class at the Moscow Conservatoire from 1922 until his death in 1957. In his Prelude and Fugue in E flat major, Opus 34, No. 2, various stylistic influences are obvious, including those of Sergei Rachmaninov and Josef Rheinberger. But what makes this truly independent composition valuable is the natural connection effected between the two poles which always stood at the centre of his professional interests: Bach and the Baroque tradition on the one hand, and Romantic music and the aesthetic of the French symphonic organ on the other.</p>
  <p>Oleg Yakovlevich Nirenburg"s Fantasy on an English Folk Song, which was written in 1985 as a middle movement of Concerto No. 1 for Organ, is based on the popular 17th century tune "There was a jolly miller". His Trio Sonata No. 2 also appeared in the year of the Bach tricentennial as a symbol of beauty, hope and great admiration, dedicated to the memory of Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
  <p>Alfred Garrievich Schnittke, in his Two small pieces for Organ, disconnects the organ from its traditions and tries to discover potential in other directions. "Although ever since childhood the organ was the instrument which featured in my daydreams, I had composed no organ music ..... until ..... 1980. I wrote out the Two Small Pieces quite spontaneously as two brief, so to speak unfinished, organ fantasias." (A.S.)<br>
