    JS Bach Organ Mass</h1>
  <p>
    The twenty-seven works of the Clavierübung III were the first organ music to be published by Bach and their appearance in 1739 allowed a wider audience to appreciate some of his greatest contrapuntal artistry. The bulk of the collection comprises twenty-one pieces based on Lutheran chorale melodies. In most cases each chorale is set twice, with one large scale work for manuals only (the exception is Allein Gott, which receives two small scale settings). The chorales chosen are among those likely to have been used most frequently because of their position in the Lutheran Mass (Kyrie, Gloria) or their relevance to the teaching of a particular aspect of faith (the Ten Commandments, Baptism, the Lord"s Prayer, the Communion).</p>
  <p>
    The twenty-one chorale settings are followed by four duets and the whole collection is framed by the great E flat major Prelude and Fugue. The present recording includes this Prelude and Fugue and each of the ten larger scale Chorale preludes, thus creating a more concise and flowing programme for the listener than would the complete Clavierübung III.</p>
  <p>
    To refer to the resulting collection of pieces as an "Organ Mass" is perhaps presumptuous, as it is unlikely that Bach would have envisaged their performance collectively in any one service, and the hymns chosen are far from being confined to the Ordinary of the Mass. However, Bach"s intention seems to have been to provide exemplary marerial not only for the teaching of keyboard technique (as implied by the title) but also to give some impression of the depth of his musical and religious experience (as is shown by the sympathetic and vivid ways in which he illustrates the theological subjects upon which the hymns are based). By acknowledging the power of music to convey and teach religious ideas, Bach is closely following the philosophy of Luther himself and making his own contribution to the mission of the Lutheran Church.</p>
  <p>
    The final work of Clavierübung III (sometimes known as the "St Anne" because of the subject's resemblance to the hymn tune of that name) is possibly Bach"s greatest fugue. Trinitarian symbolism abounds, most obviously in the fact that there are three separate fugues (representing the three persons of the Trinity) bound together into one by the use of the first subject in all three, and also in the three flats of the key signature, the number of bars in each section, the number of appearances of each fugue subject (multiples of three), and so on. Bach even makes a theological analogy by providing so much to be discovered by anyone who cares to search! This awe-inspiring and majestic work provides an appropriate conclusion to the monumental collection of music that forms Clavierübung III.</p>
